What is Telraam? ...

## Telraam on the Raspberry Pi

In this repository we make the script that runs on the Rapsberry Pi computers at each Telraam user available to the public. The goal of this - besides being completely transparent and honest about our methods - is to provide an opportunity to the public to improve upon (parts) of the original script developed at Transport & Mobility Leuven (TML, Belgium), and help the Telraam network reach its maximum potential. Please make sure to observe our CC BY-SA license.

Below you will find a list of dependencies that are needed for the script to run, a link to a detailed documentation that explains some ideas behind the script in a more detailed way than how it is done by comments placed inside the script itself, and a list of developement goals that we would like the community to pay special attention to.
